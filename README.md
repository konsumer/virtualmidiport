# virtualmidiport

This will allow you to connect one piece of MIDI software to another using virtual ports.

I haven't worked out how to cross-compile, so you'll have to do it on your own system, until I get some stuff in [releases](https://github.com/konsumer/virtualmidiport/releases)

## building

Run `npm install`, then `npm run build`
